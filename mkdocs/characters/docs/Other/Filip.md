# Filip
This dragon was made as a birthday present for Filip. It is made outside of any role-playing universe, hence it's not featured under one. Unlike most other characters, this one also features (part of) the thought process that created it in the "[Inspiration](#inspiration)" section. This section will be less formally written than the rest of the character information on this page.
