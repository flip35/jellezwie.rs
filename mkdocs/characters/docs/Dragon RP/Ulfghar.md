## Backstory
Ties to the red union, used to be a high ranking officer in the red union, after the collapse it became deprived of hope as he tried to search for a new meaning.

## Current situation 
Going around the world, hopelessly avenging anyone opposing his 'iron' fist to horde as much as possible. He tries to hord as much as possible to wait for the (inevitable) revolution to come back around, with the intent to kickstart it with massive wealth.
