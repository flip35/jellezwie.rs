<p><strong>This character is going to get revamped soon!</strong></p>
<p>Gender | Male
Item(s) | Shifting Gene
Name | Human / Western Dragon</p>
<h2 id="personality">Personality</h2>
<p>May appear shy and insecure at first, but you will see that this becomes less the case once you get to know him. He will strive for his desires and protects the ones he loves. He might seem almost unstoppable when you get him going, but he’s normally very calm. If there’s one thing he cannot stand, is knowing that someone might be mad at him, and apologies quickly when he did something wrong. He’s very intelligent and eager to learn, but since he lost most of his memories, seemingly because of his long slumber, he has a lot to catch up to.</p>
<h2 id="appearance">Appearance</h2>
<h3 id="human-form">Human form</h3>
<p>In his human form, he is almost indistinguishable from a real human, apart from his eyes, which are almost the same in both forms. He has grey eyes. His hair, which he only has in human form, is somewhere in-between dark blonde and brown.
He’s around 1.8 metres (tall in this form, which is, surprisingly, under
the average, despite having this enormous beast somewhere inside of him.</p>
<h3 id="dragon-form">Dragon form</h3>
<p>In his dragon form, he is 3.5 metres (11.5 feet) tall. He has a black skin with silver markings and thick spines on his tail. The horns on his head twist every so slightly, but not much. He can fly in this form. His teeth look supernaturally white in the sunlight.</p>
<h2 id="abilities">Abilities</h2>
<p>The ability to transform into a dragon/human. While he can
theoretically utilise all of a dragon’s abilities, he’s lagging far behind because of his memory loss. He cannot control his transformations under pressure. The lunar cycle does not affect these transformations. Transformations can cause pain during and a short while after, causing him to be slightly weakened shortly after. Furthermore, he is very intelligent and eager to learn, picking up things fairly
easily, which will come quite in handy since he has a lot to catch up on. Though it seems he’s able to master it with the proper training, he can’t really utilise magic at the moment because he hasn’t explored it yet. He is, however, able to breathe fire.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>He has awoken from a long slumber with barely any memories of his past. Not long afterwards he discovers how truly unique of a creature he is - being able to take the form of a fully fledged dragon and a human. How and why is he able to do this? He cannot possibly have been born like this. Wandering from town to town he is looking for answers to all of his questions by getting to know his past. He has a lingering voice in his head, telling him of some kind of upcoming danger. What could that possibly mean? So many questions, yet next to no answers.</p>
<h3 id="full">Full</h3>
<p>Not as long ago as you may think, but somewhere quite far away, a little kid went deep into the woods every other day. While sometimes afraid, he was too eager to not explore every nook and cranny.
One evening, deep into the woods, he forgot to watch his step and fell into a cave. He learned yet another lesson that day: rocks can be quite slippery. Just as he was about to climb his way out of the cave, he found a poor, wounded hatchling. It was a dragon… and he was bleeding. The boy went deeper into the cave to find his parents to no luck. He would never forgive himself to leave an innocent soul left to die. He picked up the dragon and ran as fast as he could home, but he was blinded by darkness. He noticed a warm sensation on his right shoulder. It was the wounded dragon using his last might to breathe fire. The beams of light exerted by the flames lit up the path and they arrived home not long after. The dragon was safe and well.</p>
<p>As the little dragon was healing, the boy desperately tried to find his parents so they could unite once again but they were nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>After searching tirelessly, the boy decided to keep the dragon. As a sort of… pet… perhaps? It felt wrong to call a dragon out of all things a “pet”. The boy knew the dragon would eventually spread hits wings, both figuratively and literally, and go live on his own. The boy and the dragon grew ever closer with each passing day.</p>
<p>The little boy became a young man and the dragon grew ever more powerful.</p>
<p>One day the dragon asked: “for the longest time you have explored the woods… have you ever thought about exploring the sky?”. The young man did not know how to answer. “Trust me, I’ll be around to take your fears away up there. Now climb on my back – you’ll regret it if you don’t. “ The young man’s eagerness overtook once again his cowardliness.</p>
<p>They soared through the sky as free as a bird but bound to each other for life.</p>
<p>Life was all well until the snake kind started to attack the village. It was devastating for many. Nobody knew what exactly they were seeking after. As the young man and his family feared death, the dragon arose: “I won’t let you take away my family a second time”. After all this time the young man finally knew why he wasn’t able to find his parents back then. His parents must have hidden him in that cave before his parents were captured by the snake kind. The young man shed a tear.</p>
<p>The dragon, with all his might and power, protected his family consisting of fragile human-beings. He became an unstoppable force. Much blood was shed that day, but at the very least not that of any human. The townsfolk no longer saw a little boy’s pet, but as a vigorous dragon.</p>
<p>A celebration was out of the question, however, as the young man sickened. It seemed the snake kind had poisoned him. His condition got worse with each passing minute with no cure in sight. The dragon felt it would not take much longer. Tonight, the young man and the dragon would be no more.</p>
<p>The town’s best mages tried to undo the bond that had been made long ago to no avail. The bond was too strong to be severed. It was so strong in fact that the young boy and the dragon could be called one and the same. The dragon closed his eyes and said as he was going under: “you make have thought it was my weakness, but it’s actually my strength.”. After the dragon spoke, a bright light from up above appeared. The young man and the dragon vanished – where did they go?</p>
