The greater it is enhanced, the more power is required. Complementary Force Provides the one on who this spell is cast with a completely new ability that complements their most prominent element. Requires much more power than enhancing an already existing ability. Shape-shifter The one on who this spell is cast takes on a different form. Requires a continuous stream of magic, thus she cannot use magic for other things in the meantime. The greater this form differs from the target's original form, the harder it will be to keep the stream going. Limitations Shape-shifting does not grant any extra abilities unless they're physically part of the form one has shape-shifted into (e.g. claws). Auxilia can only shape-shift others into forms that would make them about as powerful as they already were. Weaknesses Because of a powerful kv'naer rune, she can only use magical powers on her allies, which rules out herself or her enemies. She fully relies on others to do her bidding (who could possibly betray her). Motives She wants to dispel the kv'naer rune so she can use her powers freely. She wants to take revenge on those who destroyed her village and imprisoned her parents. History When she was still very young her village got attacked. For as young as she was, she fought back instead of fleeing to the dismay of her parents. Alongside her were many, including a powerful mage with his powers only being limited by his old age. It wasn't long before they got outnumbered by the opposing forces and she saw the mage laying down on the floor, beaten up completely. The mage looked in her eyes and, in a last-ditch effort, decided to let her have his powers instead of letting them go to waste, but did so under one condition: that she may only use her powers to help out other people. After doing so, he quickly created a portal that would bring her somewhere safe. She stepped into the portal, but not before witnessing the mage being brutally murdered. The portal closed as she stepped into it. As such, she can't use her newfound powers on herself or her enemies because of the dead mage's powerful kv'naer rune preventing her from doing so. She must rely on allies, but who's to say they won't turn against her after they have tasted her power flowing through them? After finally finding out that her parents were imprisoned after having long thought they were dead, she wanted to save them. She couldn't, however, do so on her own. She needed an ally to use her powers on. She hastily looked for anyone that would be willing to help her, and so she eventually did. She gave the man her powers to save her parents, but instead of doing so, he used them to obliterate the prison for bounty in return. Fleeing was no option for her parents and, as such, they tragically died in a sea of fire. To this day, Auxillia has a lot of trouble dealing with this, thinking that she is the reason for his parents' alleged death.

The more blood he sucks, the longer he gets to keep the ability. Mosquito's bite Can transfer over blood-related diseases from one to the other using his fangs without being affected himself. A disease must be carried over quickly for it to be effective. Depending on the severity, Cydic can also rid someone of disease in some instances. Toxic teeth Cydic can secrete acids from his fangs, causing drowsiness, nausea and/or fatigue in his victims. Requires a particular good grip, which is why it's hard to bite someone in combat. Slashing blades Cydic is skilled in wielding blades - from daggers to short swords. Hand-made cutting When unarmed, Cydic can use his claws to attack. History His ancestors, who were vampires, wanted their vampirism to be purged. Powerful magic was supposed to help them accomplish this, but a corruption in the spell caused massive, rather permanent side-effects. Whilst the serpents lost their vampirism, their fangs only grew larger, sharper. At last, a whole new kind of blood-sucking creatures was created. Several generations later, the side-effects are just as apparent as they were back then, with Cydic currently being the youngest live member of the bloodline who inherit them.

Horns among the back slightly following its curvature until the tail, where they become more rounded and point upwards. The horns on his head point straight backwards. He has a tiny horn on his nose. Due to the sharp contrast between the horns/teeth/claws and his skin, they appear very white. The inside of his wings is grey, with his plated belly being the same colour. He wears decorative bandages around his arms/legs. Abilities Blue fire The ability, also called blue flame, to breathe a special kind of blue fire so hot it can easily melt rock. As such, Jelle's skin offers natural resistance to this kind of fire as to not burn himself. He inhabited from his ancestors. Rarely if ever does one of the bloodline posses this ability despite carrying it. Vuurzee Vuurzee, \"sea of fire\", is Jelle's most well guarded secret. It is a form in which he temporarily lets the dark reiatsu within him take control over his body. It's triggered by severe emotional stress (e.g. anxiety, fury, rage) or someone attempting to corrupt him using corruption magic. His claws, teeth, and horns elongate, sharpen and whiten. The horns of his forehead twist and two small protrusions on his chin grow, being bent slightly inwards. His eyes glow more than usual and his pupils become invisible. His scales and belly plates become pointier, sawblade-like. He is stronger and ever so slightly taller in this form. His senses become more sensitive and his blue fire ability is greatly enhanced, being able to breathe nearly limitless quantities of it and the smoke coming from the flames being slightly poisonous. A longing for destruction and blood, which he may go as far to consume, fueling him. He can barely keep friend and foe apart. Any bit of his calmness or tenderness disappears, being replaced with utter terror until there's nothing left. It's incredibly difficult to calm him down in this form, let alone control it. Stages Assuming his Vuurzee form takes place in two major stages: 1. Irregular heavy breathing: Jelle can still be stopped from assuming his other form when calmed down. 2. Monstrous roar: Jelle is in the beginning stages of assuming his other form. This can no longer be prevented. The stages will play out in reverse when reverting back to his normal form. Eyes of darkness His night vision allows him to perceive his surroundings even in the darkest of conditions. He can also scare away predators with his glowy eyes which, in the dark, appear ever so slightly menacing. Crafty hands Dexterous hands allow him to handle objects with more ease compared to other dragons. Jelle is also able to stand and walk on just his two hind feet. Soaring dragon Jelle can use his wings to fly. Sharp extravaganza Jelle can use his sharp claws to deal out devastating attacks in battle. Magic During Jelle's youth, he met a canine-looking aura elemental named Thanatos who helped him get started with magic. Jelle is skilled in both fire (including some magma sub-manipulations) and dark magic, the first one more so than the second one. Fire created by fire magic generally exerts the same blue colour as his fire breath. Strengths/Weaknesses Own Attributes Strong Against Weak Against Biggest weakness When Jelle is breathing fire, shoot a stream of water into his mouth. The water needs to be cold and the stream must be strong as to not evaporate or get blown away by Jelle's breath. When successful, you will have disabled him for a moment, leaving him open for attack. Skills Alchemy Jelle knows some basic alchemy. He uses his knowledge to aid him in fire-breath performances, but also battles under certain circumstances. Current situation Jelle recently moved to Felnova and does fire-breath performances for a living. Though he has quite a large home, he lives there alone, hoping to find somebody to share it with someday. Fire-breath performer As a fire-breath performer, Jelle uses his blue fire ability to create a beautiful spectacle of flames. By throttling his fire breath, he can, besides blue fire, also create violet, red, orange and yellow fire. He uses fire magic to make his performances ever so slightly more gorgeous and clever alchemy tricks to make the scene a bit more extravagant. This, ultimately, achieves a similar effect to firework, but Jelle rarely uses this to refer to his performances as it's considered demonic, originating from Kurai. The job pays quite well, as his performances are quite one of a kind. Though he does not inherently dislike it, he feels guilty for using his blue fire ability, a great breath weapon that can burn down everything in his path, for silly shows. He wishes to find a job where his abilities can be used for something meaningful, where he could actually change things for the better and where he can reach the greatness of his ancestors. History A long time ago, one of Jelle's ancestors was a servant of the darkness. He had been given special powers to serve them, including the ability to breathe his signature blue fire, a fire so hot that it could melt rock. No matter how much power he had been given to carry out their malicious deeds, the goodness in his heart was not corruptible. The destruction he was tasked to carry out put a dent in his self-esteem, but he refused to give up, to let the darkness win yet again, to let this all be for nothing. \"No longer\", he said, as it was time to end the dark lords' regime over the lands he held dear to his heart. \"There is a way to be good again.\" With his newfound powers, he turned against them. It was a matter of time before others would join in his fight. All power he had been given backfired at them. The final blow: a blue flame that penetrated their red blaze. End to terror came, with him to mostly thank for it. His actions had been forgiven, for it was for a greater good. He had been given the name \"Bluefire\" by the divine. Motives Jelle, wants to break the notion that everyone who has connections to the dark is inherently evil, as he himself is connected to it through is ancestors. Others are quick to judge him because of this. Because of this, he does not like most Halgians. Jelle wants to stop the Faction of Hope, people who are not able to reason, whose disastrous actions hold no ground. Jelle does not believe in this \"One God\" of theirs who is not able to explain where he got his powers from. Jelle feels the need to put his powers to good use, to help people out, as he feels like not using them would be a waste. This is for many of his heroic deeds the driving force. Despite this, he often feels guilty for the people he might have killed, thinking the amount of deaths could have been less or there being a better way.

Jelle feels the need to put his powers to good use, to help people out, as he feels like not using them would be a waste. This is for many of his heroic deeds the driving force. Despite this, he often feels guilty for the people he might have killed, thinking the amount of deaths could have been less or there being a better way.","title":"Motives"},{"location":"By Tooth and Claw Dragons/Jelle Bluefire/#miccelaneous","text":"","title":"Miccelaneous"},{"location":"By Tooth and Claw Dragons/Jelle Bluefire/#inspired-by","text":"Giga Bowser ( Super Mario Wiki ) Drakenkoningin ( Amazon ) The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim ( Steam ) Leonidas ( Bakugan Wiki ) Charizard X ( Pok\u00e9mon )","title":"Inspired by"},{"location":"By Tooth and Claw Dragons/Jelle Bluefire/#special-thanks","text":"Mavanger ( By Tooth and Claw Dragons ) Verridith ( By Tooth and Claw Dragons )","title":"Special thanks"},{"location":"By Tooth and Claw Dragons/Jelle Bluefire/#credits","text":"Artwork (c) R8A-creations ( DeviantArt ) Sprites (c) By Tooth and Claw Dragons ( attributions )","title":"Credits"},{"location":"By Tooth and Claw Dragons/Jesse/","text":"Jesse This character is going to get revamped soon! Gender | Male Item(s) | Shifting Gene Name | Human / Western Dragon Personality May appear shy and insecure at first, but you will see that this becomes less the case once you get to know him. He will strive for his desires and protects the ones he loves. He might seem almost unstoppable when you get him going, but he\u2019s normally very calm. If there\u2019s one thing he cannot stand, is knowing that someone might be mad at him, and apologies quickly when he did something wrong. He\u2019s very intelligent and eager to learn, but since he lost most of his memories, seemingly because of his long slumber, he has a lot to catch up to. Appearance Human form In his human form, he is almost indistinguishable from a real human, apart from his eyes, which are almost the same in both forms. He has grey eyes. His hair, which he only has in human form, is somewhere in-between dark blonde and brown. He\u2019s around 1.8 metres (tall in this form, which is, surprisingly, under the average, despite having this enormous beast somewhere inside of him. Dragon form In his dragon form, he is 3.5 metres (11.5 feet) tall. He has a black skin with silver markings and thick spines on his tail. The horns on his head twist every so slightly, but not much. He can fly in this form. His teeth look supernaturally white in the sunlight. Abilities The ability to transform into a dragon/human. While he can theoretically utilise all of a dragon\u2019s abilities, he\u2019s lagging far behind because of his memory loss. He cannot control his transformations under pressure. The lunar cycle does not affect these transformations. Transformations can cause pain during and a short while after, causing him to be slightly weakened shortly after. Furthermore, he is very intelligent and eager to learn, picking up things fairly easily, which will come quite in handy since he has a lot to catch up on. Though it seems he\u2019s able to master it with the proper training, he can\u2019t really utilise magic at the moment because he hasn\u2019t explored it yet. He is, however, able to breathe fire. History Summary He has awoken from a long slumber with barely any memories of his past. Not long afterwards he discovers how truly unique of a creature he is - being able to take the form of a fully fledged dragon and a human. How and why is he able to do this? He cannot possibly have been born like this. Wandering from town to town he is looking for answers to all of his questions by getting to know his past. He has a lingering voice in his head, telling him of some kind of upcoming danger. What could that possibly mean? So many questions, yet next to no answers. Full Not as long ago as you may think, but somewhere quite far away, a little kid went deep into the woods every other day. While sometimes afraid, he was too eager to not explore every nook and cranny. One evening, deep into the woods, he forgot to watch his step and fell into a cave. He learned yet another lesson that day: rocks can be quite slippery. Just as he was about to climb his way out of the cave, he found a poor, wounded hatchling. It was a dragon\u2026 and he was bleeding. The boy went deeper into the cave to find his parents to no luck. He would never forgive himself to leave an innocent soul left to die. He picked up the dragon and ran as fast as he could home, but he was blinded by darkness. He noticed a warm sensation on his right shoulder. It was the wounded dragon using his last might to breathe fire. The beams of light exerted by the flames lit up the path and they arrived home not long after. The dragon was safe and well. As the little dragon was healing, the boy desperately tried to find his parents so they could unite once again but they were nowhere to be found. After searching tirelessly, the boy decided to keep the dragon. As a sort of\u2026 pet\u2026 perhaps? It felt wrong to call a dragon out of all things a \u201cpet\u201d. The boy knew the dragon would eventually spread hits wings, both figuratively and literally, and go live on his own. The boy and the dragon grew ever closer with each passing day. The little boy became a young man and the dragon grew ever more powerful. One day the dragon asked: \u201cfor the longest time you have explored the woods\u2026 have you ever thought about exploring the sky?\u201d. The young man did not know how to answer. \u201cTrust me, I\u2019ll be around to take your fears away up there. Now climb on my back \u2013 you\u2019ll regret it if you don\u2019t. \u201c The young man\u2019s eagerness overtook once again his cowardliness. They soared through the sky as free as a bird but bound to each other for life. Life was all well until the snake kind started to attack the village. It was devastating for many. Nobody knew what exactly they were seeking after. As the young man and his family feared death, the dragon arose: \u201cI won\u2019t let you take away my family a second time\u201d. After all this time the young man finally knew why he wasn\u2019t able to find his parents back then. His parents must have hidden him in that cave before his parents were captured by the snake kind. The young man shed a tear. The dragon, with all his might and power, protected his family consisting of fragile human-beings. He became an unstoppable force. Much blood was shed that day, but at the very least not that of any human. The townsfolk no longer saw a little boy\u2019s pet, but as a vigorous dragon. A celebration was out of the question, however, as the young man sickened. It seemed the snake kind had poisoned him. His condition got worse with each passing minute with no cure in sight. The dragon felt it would not take much longer. Tonight, the young man and the dragon would be no more. The town\u2019s best mages tried to undo the bond that had been made long ago to no avail. The bond was too strong to be severed. It was so strong in fact that the young boy and the dragon could be called one and the same. The dragon closed his eyes and said as he was going under: \u201cyou make have thought it was my weakness, but it\u2019s actually my strength.\u201d. After the dragon spoke, a bright light from up above appeared. The young man and the dragon vanished \u2013 where did they go?","title":"Jesse"},{"location":"By Tooth and Claw Dragons/Jesse/#jesse","text":"This character is going to get revamped soon!
